# Implementations of MRPT approximate nearest neighbour search in various programming languages

![Six trees](2dExample.png "Sample trees built on a 2-d data set")

## What?
This repository contains a number of implementations for the approximate nearest neighbour method of multiple random projection trees (MRPT). The method is a result of research conducted at Helsinki Institute for Information Technology (HIIT).

MRPT is a spatial method where the data space is divided by randomly chosen hyperplanes. The method is particularly effective in use cases that involve high dimensional and high sample size data sets.

## Languages
As of now we support MATLAB, Python and C++.
