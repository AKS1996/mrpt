    A LIGHTER VERSION OF A RP-TREE. BENEFITS ARE QUESTIONABLE.
    A Random Projection Tree is a spatial index data structure used in specific data mining and indexing tasks. Our
    implementation has been built with approximate nearest neighbor search (ANN) problems in mind. A tree is built by
    dividing the data space by random hyperplanes into small cells. In ANN-problems we usually achieve substantial
    improvements by quickly choosing just a subset of the data located in a single cell where the actual brute-force NN
    search is then performed, instead of using the whole data set.
