    The MRPT index is basically just a collection of RP trees. Query results are formed by combining the results of
    single trees. The constructor builds a user-specified number of trees with a user-specified maximum leaf-size. The
    current version can use pre-built saved trees to speed up -- if there are trees built for the same data set with the
    same leaf size those will be used. If the use_saved option is allowed but the index needs more trees than there
    exists in the pre-built collection, as many new trees will be built as needed. The new trees are also added to the
    collection.
