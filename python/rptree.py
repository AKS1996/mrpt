    A Random Projection Tree is a spatial index data structure used in specific data mining and indexing tasks. Our

    dividing the data space by random hyperplanes into small cells. In ANN-problems we usually achieve substantial
    improvements by quickly choosing just a subset of the data located in a single cell where the actual brute-force NN
    search is then performed.
