    The MRPT index is basically just a collection of RP trees. Query results are formed by combining the results of
    single trees. The constructor builds a user-specified number of trees with a user-specified maximum leaf-size. The
    current version can use pre-built saved trees to speed up -- if there are trees built for the same data set with the
    same leaf size those will be used. If the use_saved option is allowed but the index needs more trees than there
    exists in the pre-built collection, as many new trees will be built as needed. The new trees are also added to the
    collection.

        The mrpt approximate nearest neighbor query. By default the function implements a basic query - the query object
        is routed to one leaf in each tree, and the nearest neighbors are searched in the union of these leaves. The
        extra parameters allow some performance-improving tricks. The parameter extra_brances allows the query to
        explore extra branches where the projection value was close to the split. The n_elected parameter causes the
        query to use the voting trick - not all objects in the union of leaves are searched, but only those that were
        returned by several trees.
