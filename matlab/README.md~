#MATLAB implementation of the MRPT algorithm

##Get started
The MATLAB implementation is dependent on some simple Java structures, thus
before using the method some simple procedures need to be undertaken.

First, you need to compile the Java class `java/RPTNode.java` by typing in 
a terminal window
    javac -source <version> -target <version> java/RPTNode.java,
where <version> is the java version supported by your MATLAB installation 
(1.7 for MATLAB R2014b)

Next, you need to include this class to your Java path. This happens by 
typing
    javaaddpath ./java
to the MATLAB command window while working in the `mrpt/matlab` directory
