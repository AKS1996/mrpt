        The mrpt approximate nearest neighbor query. By default the function implements a basic query - the query object
        is routed to one leaf in each tree, and the nearest neighbors are searched in the union of these leaves. The
        extra parameters allow some tricks to improve performance. The parameter extra_brances allows the query to
        explore extra branches where the projection value was close to the split. The n_elected parameter causes the
        query to use the voting trick - not all objects in the union of leaves are searched, but the appearance counts
        as a vote and only the most voted objects get 'elected' to be searched. Thus an object must be returned by
        several trees to be included in the linear search.
